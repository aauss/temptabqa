This outcome can be inferred from the caption and the information provided in the infobox. The dissolution of the Soviet Union was a result of the political and economic changes that were taking place in the Soviet Union during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the decline of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) and the growing demand for independence among the Soviet republics.On November 16, 1988, the Soviet government, led by Mikhail Gorbachev, signed the Belovezh Accords, which recognized the dissolution of the Soviet Union and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) between 11 of the newly independent states. Over the next three years, the remaining Soviet republics declared their independence, and the Soviet Union was officially dissolved on December 26, 1991.The outcome of this event was the establishment of 15 independent states, including Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and others. These states moved to adopt capitalist market economies and declare multi-party presidential or semi-presidential systems. The Soviet Armed Forces were divided and relocated, and the Black Sea Fleet was partitioned and negotiated for relocation between Russia and Ukraine.The dissolution of the Soviet Union also led to numerous military conflicts and ethnic clashes, provoking humanitarian crises and leaving many internally displaced. The value of savings of former Soviet citizens was lost, and social and medical support for veterans of the Soviet-Afghan War were also affected. The end of the Cold War and the decline of communist movements around the world were also outcomes of this event."
