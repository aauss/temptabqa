However, their popularity began to decline in the late 1970s and early 1980s, due to a series of violent attacks and kidnappings that alienated many of their supporters. The kidnapping and murder of Aldo Moro in 1978 was a particularly significant blow to the Red Brigades' popular support, as it was seen as a brutal and unjustifiable act.On the other hand, the main far-right terrorist groups in Italy, such as Ordine Nuovo and Avanguardia Nazionale, did not experience a significant decline in popular support until the early 1980s. These groups were responsible for a number of violent attacks and bombings throughout the 1970s, but they continued to receive support from some segments of the population, particularly among the far-right and neofascist movements. It was not until the early 1980s, when the Italian government began to crack down on far-right terrorism and the P2 Masonic Lodge scandal came to light, that the popular support for these groups began to decline.Therefore, the collapse of popular support for the Red Brigades came before the dismantling of the main far-right terrorist groups in Italy."
