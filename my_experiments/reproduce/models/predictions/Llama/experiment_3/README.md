# Short protocol of 3rd experiment

## What did I do?

In experiment 3, I rewrote [experiment 2](../experiment_2/README.md) to use Llama 2 70b instead of the 7b chat model. The reason behind it is that the TempTapQA paper too used this model for llama 2. Furthermore, I added a few lines to produce checkpoints.

## Modification of results

## Code to produce this result

A python script is added in this folder to describe the way I did prompting to produce these results. Note, you will need to adopt paths to re-run experiments
